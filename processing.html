    HOLD DOWN THE MOUSE TO PICK UP THE BALL AND LET GO TO LET IT KEEP MOVING.

    This project took a lot of troubleshooting to deal with. A lot of factors
    decided to kick in when I wanted to upload the JavaScript function, like the
    original website no longer being available for my use (my fault, domain
    problems). I needed to create a new site and just as I got it set up, I
    needed to figure out how to get the JavaScript program working in the
    website. Unfortunately, this did not leave me much time out of the two days
    we have been working on this.
    <br><br>
    My biggest gripe about my work is that I didn’t go further than what I had
    learned in class, something that I have been trying to do in all my
    projects. This was something simple, and considering how rushed this project
    was, I accepted that I need to priorities other work, like writing the
    statement and other final assignments in other classes.
    <br><br>
    I wanted to make this project as fast as possible, something that feels like
    a “party”, but doesn’t make you nauseous. So I figured I try to modify the
    original “ball” project, and make the party idea go on from there.
