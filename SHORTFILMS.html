  <h2 style="margin:10px; white-space: nowrap;">THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD (2018)</h2>
  <p>
    Near the beginning of the spring 2018 semester in San Jose State, I began
    writing a short film that I had no idea how to write. It involved themes
    that I had little to no experience in, and the only experience in film making
    I had was a short film in 2015 that I felt didn't succeed in its purpose. So
    making this new, extremely ambitious one was a bit of a stretch. I figured
    that because I was older and perhaps wiser, I'd be able to make a good film
    without that said experience.
    <br><br>
    What ended up happening is that my Digital Media class required a short video
    instead. So in order to manage my time, I stopped writing that film and instead
    focused on a short script for what will be this film.
    <br><br>
    Making this film was not only a blast to make, but also a huge blessing and
    fountain of experience. I learned so much about how to write a film, as well
    as direct one too. It helped me understand that not all ideas are communicated
    in an the manner the writer always wants them to. It also helped me understand
    that checkking the camera between every shot is (REALLY) important.
