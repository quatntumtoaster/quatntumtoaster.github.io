    I honestly had no idea what to do with this. The beginning of the semester
    was a rush of ideas form a new major and a new environment, that I didn’t
    know how to make sense of the assignments given to me. It was difficult to
    understand the entire idea behind the assignments and it showed. When going
    over other people’s work, I see so much meaning behind their art. There are
    other feelings in there than just what’s on the surface, and I felt that in
    terms of narrative, my remix falls short.

    Overall, despite my comparisons, I think my remix was good. People caught on
    to what I meant with the image pretty quickly, and I am glad that it was
    easily understandable. So much of the world is passing by while we are on
    our phones, but we need to get off the screens that capture so much of our
    attention and replace it with face to face socializing. Only then when we
    look up will we realize the life around us, both the good and the bad.
