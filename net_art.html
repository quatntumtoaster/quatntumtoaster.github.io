      One of the hard things about having an amazing idea is that the result might
      not end up being what you want it to be. That was, unfortunately, the case
      for my project. This art piece it the culmination of my procrastination.
      Memes help me when I want a laugh, but they are alluring, constantly begging
      for my attention. While I DID want to do something cool, like a text-based
      choice game, I realized that it was not going to be possible with the time
      frame given (and my inability to stay focused on writing the frickn' story).
      So, I chose to do something inspired by the college student's worst nightmare.
      <br><br>

      The art piece is a gif filled with links around it. While simple, you will
      first be greeted by a very loud sound that might sound like music, but alas,
      it is the cries of the hours of sleep washed away. The humor here just
      represents my grasp at trying to come up with a replacement project when
      there was less than 12 hours before the project was due. It is quick, but
      shallow. All the self-deprecation throughout the work as well as this
      statement represents my knowledge that this is pretty much all my fault
      at this point. I could have started earlier. I could have chosen a better
      project. But instead, I chose a difficult idea that could not be well
      done in 2 weeks by a novice/intermediate web-programmer, if at all.
      <br><br>

      Above all, I hope that this art serves a purpose. While yes, I would
      prefer if no one takes the time to analyze how much time actually went
      into this, I would like for anyone who sees it to see the lesson I learned.
      I don’t want to get this stressed about a project then be extremely ashamed
      of the result like this one again. On top of that, I also wanted to somewhat
      point out how annoying this meme culture can be sometimes while still being
      very comical. But that is not the real purpose, just something I came up with
      hours before the due date…
