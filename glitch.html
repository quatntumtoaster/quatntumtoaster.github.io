    A popular game out when this was made was a game called Doki Doki Literature
    Club. The game itself is a horror game hidden as a cutesy visual novel. The
    character I chose to highlight in this glitch gif is a girl who has become
    self-aware and uses the game to get closer to you, the player. She fell in
    love with you and is manipulating the game’s code to change her role in the
    game. This then causes a lot of glitches and really odd interactions with
    the other girls in the game.
    <br><br>
    I wanted to capture the freakiness of the game while keeping it simple. It
    wasn’t a project we were allowed much time on, and with resources, I think
    I did the best I could do with this gif.
